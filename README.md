# DirectoryClone
Java desktop app to scan and store tree structure of provided path.
Can be used to store a list of files as a backup measure or simply to keep track of *movies and shows* you have/had .

### WHY?
**(FOR COLLECTORS ONLY)**

Ever been in the situation where :
+ You need to backup your collection of **MOVIES**, **TV SHOWS**, **SONGS** and *some other stuff*
+ It is too much to make a backup and update it everytime.
+ You can re-download it whenever you need only if you know about everyfile you had.

**NO ?** NEVER MIND.

**YES ?** Here is what you can do.
+ Make a **backup of important documents** .
+ Upload **Pictures on Google Drive** or any other cloud storage.
+ For Paid games : **Steam or any other gaming client** will remember your list.
+ USE THE TOOL TO MAKE A LIST OF **GAMES, MOVIES, TV-SHOWS, SONGS etc.** and store the file on cloud. **EZZZ**

**Happy ?**

No ? You can always buy couple extra Hard-Drives.

Yes ? Git Clone.

Not sure ? You are **NOT A COLLECTOR** then. You dont have the urge to keep everything for yourself, forever . **#collectors_will_understand.**

### ABOUT THE TOOL
 Made on JAVA using Scene Builder.
 The methods are generic(Not OS dependent), should work on all OS(thats why JAVA).
 I have tested it on WINDOWS only.
 You can always clone and make couple changes to run it on MAC OR LINUX.

 ### How to use ? 
The tool is self understood. I have included usage tips while hovering over fields and buttons.

DEEP SCAN : To include all the subfolders and files under a directory. For **MOVIES, TV-SHOWS, SONGS etc.**
  
SHALLOW SCAN : To scan just the provided folder. For **Games** (mostly).

**DO NOT RUN *DEEP SCAN* FOR FOLDERS WITH A LOT OF SUBFOLDERS eg. OS FILES OR GAMES**

STEPS : 
+ Click on *Choose* button to input a directory.
+ Choose the type of Scan to perform, *DEEP* or *SHALLOW*.
+ Check on *APPEND NEW SCAN* if you want to perform another scan and want to keep the older results as well.
+ Check the *textArea* for scan results.
+ If satisfied, provide *Output path* and *filename*(without extension) and click on *Save* to write to the file.
